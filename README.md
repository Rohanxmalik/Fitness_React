INTRODUCTION
I created a fitness app using React to understand which muscle(s) is being targeted for each exercise routine. The application uses Rapid API to specify the exercise and provide the youtube video for the same. With the functionality to choose exercise categories and specific muscle groups, browse more than one thousand exercises with practical examples, pagination, exercise details, pull related videos from youtube, display similar exercises, and much more.
User can search any exercise or muscle he wants to train from the search bar, all the exercise relate to the muscles will show up on a card which shows the targeted muscles and the correct technique of the execise, all the videos related to the execise will show below it and the user can directly click on the card to play the video on youtube.
This web app was built with:

ReactJS

Axios

Material UI

Rapid API
